> [!IMPORTANT]
> Packages on this repository were last updated on 28 February 2025. RVBA and the Optimal Project, which it was made for, are being fully rewritten. There is currently no ETA for when this process will be completed for Optimal v11 and RVBA v2. Everything below this banner should be treated as a deprecated archive.

### *Packages Last Updated: `31 March 2024` at `2:05PM EST`
### RVBA and Optimal v11 are undergoing major revisions. You can still use RVBA to patch apps with ReVanced Manager but they may not be the most up-to-date target versions.

RVBA's web UI is being rewritten.

## About
This repository hosts direct download access for recommended base apps (APKs) for patching through [ReVanced](https://revanced.app) Manager and the [Optimal project](https://github.com/gabefletch/optimal-v11). Each app that is patchable through ReVanced Manager has a specific recommended version that will offer the greatest chance of success and/or patch compatibility.<br>

## What About (insert app)?
### Other Apps Supported by ReVanced
Many of the other apps that can be patched via ReVanced Manager do not have patches that align with the goal of the Optimal project. For example, Spotify can be patched by ReVanced but does not have patches that unlock Premium features. Optimal instead supports xManager which does allow for Premium unlocking.<br>

We may decide to add other apps that are supported by ReVanced Manager as time goes by.
