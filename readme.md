## About
This repository hosts direct download access for recommended base apps (APKs) for patching through [ReVanced](https://revanced.app) Manager and the [Optimal project](https://github.com/gabefletch/optimal-v11). Each app that is patchable through ReVanced Manager has a specific recommended version that will offer the greatest chance of success and/or patch compatibility.<br>

## What About (insert app)?
### Other Apps Supported by ReVanced
Many of the other apps that can be patched via ReVanced Manager do not have patches that align with the goal of the Optimal project. For example, Spotify can be patched by ReVanced but does not have patches that unlock Premium features. Optimal instead supports xManager which does allow for Premium unlocking.<br>

We may decide to add other apps that are supported by ReVanced Manager as time goes by.
